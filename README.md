# Claude Code Starter Templates

Free, battle-tested CLAUDE.md templates to supercharge your Claude Code experience.

## What is CLAUDE.md?

When you create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root, Claude Code reads it at the start of every conversation. It gives Claude persistent context about your project: tech stack, conventions, build commands, and common gotchas.

A good CLAUDE.md is the difference between Claude starting from zero every session and Claude acting like a team member who knows your codebase.

## Free Templates
